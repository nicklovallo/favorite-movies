# Favorite Movies

I wouldn’t exactly call myself a cinephile or movie buff, but I do really appreciate the film art form. One of my favorite questions for friends is asking them what their top 10 favorite movies of all time are. I think it gives some good insight into someone’s personality and interests.

I built this project using the Flask framework for Python. On this app, users can create an account and log on, create their list of favorite movies, and view the lists of their friends.
